  <p class="pp2">I have a real passion for coding & designing browsers with HTML(5), CSS(3), JavaScript and a touch of JQuery.
                  I love coding from scratch as it enables me to learn the in's and out's of Web Development.
                  With this in mind, I am also able to work with Angular.js, PHP, Python and front end frameworks.</p>

<h2 class="contribute">What I can contribute<br> to your organisation<h2>
      <p class="passion">My enthusiasm and passion for building and designing websites has enabled me to become experienced and confident in using common HTML5 API's, 
         adding advanced graphics to an HTML5 page using Canvas elements as well as Scalable Vector Graphics to enhance user experience with the inclusion of animations.
          As a proactive & motivated person I believe my professionalism and web developing capabilities will make a significant contribution to your 
         organisation.</p>
